### ULTRAKILL Trainer
Updates and FAQ

### Act 2 Update?
Since all of the previous work got nulled, I will need to dedicate time to finding thing's that do not crash the game on use when finishing the level, changing to sandbox... It's tedious, and it takes time to compile the list I had before (so it's consistent and usable). Right now, the latest Pre-Release has basic weapon ammo editing with some neat info texts. You can get it here: [3.0.0](https://github.com/Saniee/ULTRAKILLTrainer/releases/tag/3.0.0)
<br>As time progresses new features/hacks will be added.
<br><br><b>In short, it will take time to get back to the previous state of this trainer/hack.</b>
