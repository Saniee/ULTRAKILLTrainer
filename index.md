### There are only Pre-Release versions
<b>The application as is right now has several broken things:<b/>
- Upon winning a level, disable everything. Since the game will crash if not done so.
- Some Features can be buggy/not work. If they don't work, please tell me [here](https://github.com/Saniee/ULTRAKILLTrainer/issues/new).

<b>I am actively trying to solve these problems, as the project/rewrite continues.<b/>
